# Tic Tac Toe Game

![Tic Tac toe.jpeg]

A simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on the grid to place their marks (X or O).
- **Win/Draw Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Pop-up Modal**: A modal appears to announce the winner or if the game is a draw.
- **Reset Button**: Players can reset the game at any time.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Social Links**: Includes links to my LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub profiles.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the game board and layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling the game, including animations and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, including win/draw detection and DOM manipulation.
- **Font Awesome**: For social media icons.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Player X starts first. Click on any empty cell to place an X.
3. Player O will go next. Alternate turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
4. If a player wins or the game is a draw, a pop-up modal will appear with the result.
5. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
